# Readme-AI ‚ú®

<<<<<<< HEAD
## üìñ About the Project

Writing good documentation is essential but often time-consuming. **Readme-AI** was born out of a need to automate and simplify this process. This tool analyzes a given GitHub repository, understands its structure and dependencies, scans all the files automatically, and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a high-quality, well-structured `README.md` file.

This project was developed as part of the **FUTURESTACK GENAI HACKATHON**. Our goal was to create a developer tool that boosts productivity and encourages better documentation practices.
